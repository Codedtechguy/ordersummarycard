# Coded Tech Guy - Order summary card solution

This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge found on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). 

Front end mentor provides real live challenges and projects for front end developers to build their skills and showcase their skills. And as such, I decided to take up this challenge.
